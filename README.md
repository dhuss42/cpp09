# cpp09

This module is focused on introducing and practicing the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. Each exercise in this module must be solved using STL containers, with a strict limitation: once a container is used in one exercise, it cannot be reused in the others. Exercises 00 and 01 require the use of one container each, while Exercise 02 requires the use of two different containers.
